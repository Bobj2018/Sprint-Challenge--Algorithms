#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)

```
The loops make this a O(n)
```

b)

```
Because of the nested loops, it makes it O(n^2)
```

c)
```
This is O(n), it will eventually reach 0.
```

## Exercise II

```python
# find the middle floor (n // 2)

# Check if egg breaks == True; proceed to  move halfway up to the top floor.
# Check if egg breaks == False; proceed to  move halfway up to the bottom floor.
# Recurse through until the amount of eggs broken is minimal

# The Big O is O(n log n) because it keeps on dividing the floor
```
